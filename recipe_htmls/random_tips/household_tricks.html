        1) For badly stained hands from gardening, add a tsp sugar to the soapy
        lather you wash them in <br />
        <br />
        2) Bee Sting -- apply a slice of onion to a bee sting, it will stop the
        pain and swelling. <br /><br />
        3) Jewelry -- Tooth paste on an old tooth brush is excellent to clean
        jewelry <br />
        <br />
        4) Nuts -- To get walnut meats out of whole nuts, soak the nuts on night
        in salt water before you crack them. <br />
        <br />
        5) Eggs -- To keep eggs from cracking when you boil them in the shell,
        add a teaspoon salt to the water. <br />
